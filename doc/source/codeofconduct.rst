Contributor Code of Conduct
---------------------------

Pylightxl as with many other python open source projects practices an open
and welcoming community for users and contributors. The following is our
minimum expectation:

- A diverse community is a great community, and everyone is welcomed here,
  no matter the age, race, gender or background.

- Practice upmost respect for our users and maintainers. Maintainers answering issues
  on github or stackoverflow should always start by thanking the individual for considering
  using the tool, then begin to help them. Users, please be patient with our developers
  we try to test as much we can, but there will always be edge cases - just know that we
  are here to help you!
